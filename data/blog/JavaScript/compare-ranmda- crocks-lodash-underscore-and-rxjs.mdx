Ramda, Crocks, Lodash, Underscore, and RxJS are four widely used JavaScript libraries. The post wants to summairze their functionalities.

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Introduction" />

### 1. Ramda

Ramda is a popular functional programming library for JavaScript that provides a set of utility functions to facilitate functional programming paradigms. Here's an overview of its key features and principles:

#### Core Principles

1. **Functional First**: Ramda emphasizes a functional programming style, encouraging pure functions and immutability.

2. **Immutability**: All functions in Ramda are pure and do not mutate data. They always return new data structures.

3. **Currying**: All functions in Ramda are automatically curried, allowing for partial application of functions.

4. **Data-Last**: Ramda functions typically take the data to operate on as their last argument, making them more composable.

#### Key Features

1. **Function Composition**: Ramda provides utilities like `R.compose` and `R.pipe` for elegant function composition.

2. **List Operations**: A wide array of functions for working with arrays, including `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and more specialized operations.

3. **Object Operations**: Functions for working with object properties, merging objects, and creating lenses for immutable updates.

4. **Logic Functions**: Utilities for creating predicates and combining logical operations.

5. **Mathematical Operations**: A set of mathematical functions that work well with Ramda's functional style.

6. **String Manipulation**: Functions for working with strings in a functional manner.

7. **Type Checking**: Utility functions for checking types in a functional way.

#### Common Functions

Some frequently used Ramda functions include:

- `R.map`: Apply a function to each element in a list
- `R.filter`: Filter a list based on a predicate
- `R.reduce`: Reduce a list to a single value
- `R.compose`: Compose functions right to left
- `R.pipe`: Compose functions left to right
- `R.curry`: Curry a function
- `R.prop`: Extract a property from an object
- `R.path`: Extract a nested property from an object
- `R.lens`: Create a lens for immutable object updates

#### Example Usage

```javascript
const R = require('ramda')

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const double = (x) => x * 2
const isEven = (x) => x % 2 === 0

const doubleEvenNumbers = R.pipe(R.filter(isEven), R.map(double))

console.log(doubleEvenNumbers(numbers)) // [4, 8]

const person = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 }
const getAge = R.prop('age')
console.log(getAge(person)) // 30
```

#### Benefits of Using Ramda

1. **Predictability**: Pure functions and immutability lead to more predictable code.
2. **Reusability**: Highly composable functions encourage code reuse.
3. **Readability**: Expressive function names and composition can lead to more readable code.
4. **Testing**: Pure functions are easier to test.

#### Considerations

1. **Learning Curve**: The functional programming paradigm may require a shift in thinking for some developers.
2. **Performance**: In some cases, creating new data structures instead of mutating existing ones can have performance implications.
3. **Debugging**: Stack traces can be more complex due to function composition.

Ramda provides a robust toolkit for functional programming in JavaScript, encouraging clean, modular, and reusable code. Its emphasis on immutability and function composition can lead to more maintainable and predictable codebases.

- `Result`: A specialized version of Either focused on representing success or failure.
- `State`: Represents computations which carry state.
- `Reader`: Represents computations which can read from a shared environment.
- `Writer`: Represents computations which can produce a stream of output.
- `Async`: Represents asynchronous computations.
- `compose`, `pipe`: Functions for composing other functions.
- `curry`: Function for currying other functions.
- `map`, `chain`, `ap`: Common operations on ADTs.

#### Example Usage

```javascript
const { compose, curry, map, Maybe } = require('crocks')

// A safe division function using Maybe
const safeDivide = curry((n, d) => (d === 0 ? Maybe.Nothing() : Maybe.Just(n / d)))

// Compose functions to safely divide and then double the result
const safeDoubleDiv = compose(
  map((x) => x * 2),
  safeDivide(10)
)

console.log(safeDoubleDiv(2).option('Cannot divide')) // 10
console.log(safeDoubleDiv(0).option('Cannot divide')) // "Cannot divide"

// Using Either for error handling
const { Either } = require('crocks')
const { Left, Right } = Either

const sqrt = (n) =>
  n < 0 ? Left('Cannot calculate square root of negative number') : Right(Math.sqrt(n))

console.log(
  sqrt(-1).either(
    (error) => `Error: ${error}`,
    (value) => `The result is ${value}`
  )
) // "Error: Cannot calculate square root of negative number"

console.log(
  sqrt(4).either(
    (error) => `Error: ${error}`,
    (value) => `The result is ${value}`
  )
) // "The result is 2"
```

  { user: 'fred', age: 40 },
  { user: 'barney', age: 36 },
]

// Get the average age of users
const averageAge = _.meanBy(users, 'age')
console.log(averageAge) // 39.5

// Group users by name
const groupedUsers = _.groupBy(users, 'user')
console.log(groupedUsers)
// {
//   fred: [{ user: 'fred', age: 48 }, { user: 'fred', age: 40 }],
//   barney: [{ user: 'barney', age: 34 }, { user: 'barney', age: 36 }]
// }

- `_.where`: Return all elements that match the given properties.
- `_.extend`: Copy all properties from source objects to a destination object.
- `_.debounce`: Create a debounced version of a function.
- `_.template`: Create a compiled template function.

#### Example Usage

```javascript
const _ = require('underscore')

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

// Using map to double each number
const doubled = _.map(numbers, (num) => num * 2)
console.log(doubled) // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

// Using reduce to sum the numbers
const sum = _.reduce(numbers, (memo, num) => memo + num, 0)
console.log(sum) // 15

// Using where to find objects with specific properties
const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 25 },
  { name: 'Jane', age: 30 },
  { name: 'John', age: 35 },
]
const johnsOver30 = _.where(users, { name: 'John', age: 35 })
console.log(johnsOver30) // [{name: 'John', age: 35}]

// Using template

Underscore remains a solid choice for projects that require broad browser support or maintain legacy codebases. Its influence on JavaScript development is significant, and many developers still appreciate its straightforward, functional approach to utility functions.

### 5.RxJS

RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for reactive programming using Observables, to make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code. It provides one core type, the Observable, satellite types (Observer, Schedulers, Subjects) and operators inspired by Array methods (map, filter, reduce, every, etc) to allow handling asynchronous events as collections.

#### Core Principles

1. **Reactive Programming**: RxJS is built around the concept of reactive programming, which focuses on asynchronous data streams.
2. **Functional Programming**: It leverages functional programming concepts for transforming and combining streams of data.
3. **Composition**: RxJS emphasizes the composition of operations on data streams.
4. **Declarative**: It allows for a more declarative programming style, especially when dealing with complex asynchronous operations.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Observable**: Represents a stream of data or events over time.
2. **Observer**: Consumes the values delivered by an Observable.
3. **Subscription**: Represents the execution of an Observable.
4. **Operators**: Pure functions that enable functional programming style transformations of Observables.
5. **Subject**: A special type of Observable that allows values to be multicasted to many Observers.
6. **Schedulers**: Control the execution context and timing of subscription and notifications.

#### Common Operators

RxJS provides a wide range of operators for working with Observables:

- `map`: Transform the items emitted by an Observable by applying a function to each item.
- `filter`: Emit only those items from an Observable that pass a predicate test.
- `mergeMap`: Transform the items emitted by an Observable into Observables, then flatten the emissions.
- `switchMap`: Map to Observable, complete previous inner Observable, emit values.
- `concat`: Join multiple Observables together by sequentially emitting their values.
- `combineLatest`: Combine the latest values from multiple Observables.
- `debounceTime`: Discard emitted values that take less than the specified time between outputs.
- `takeUntil`: Emit values until a second Observable emits a value.

#### Example Usage

```javascript
import { fromEvent, interval } from 'rxjs'
import { map, filter, takeUntil } from 'rxjs/operators'

// Create an Observable that emits click events
const clicks$ = fromEvent(document, 'click')

// Create an Observable that emits a value every second
const timer$ = interval(1000)

// Use operators to transform the timer Observable
const subscription = timer$
  .pipe(
    map((i) => i + 1),
    filter((i) => i % 2 === 0),
    takeUntil(clicks$)
  )
  .subscribe(
    (value) => console.log(`Even number: ${value}`),
    (err) => console.error(err),
    () => console.log('Completed')
  )

// This will log even numbers every 2 seconds until a click event occurs
```

#### Benefits of Using RxJS

1. **Handling Complex Async Operations**: Simplifies management of multiple async operations and their interdependencies.
2. **Composition**: Allows for easy composition of async operations using a functional programming style.
3. **Declarative Approach**: Enables a more declarative approach to handling async data flows.
4. **Cancellation**: Built-in mechanisms for cancelling async operations.
5. **Rich Ecosystem**: Extensive set of operators for various use cases.
6. **Error Handling**: Provides robust error handling mechanisms for async operations.

#### Considerations

1. **Learning Curve**: The concepts in RxJS can be challenging for developers new to reactive programming.
2. **Debugging**: Debugging RxJS code can be more complex due to its asynchronous nature.
3. **Overuse**: Not every async operation needs the power of RxJS; simpler solutions might suffice for basic scenarios.
4. **Bundle Size**: Including the full RxJS library can significantly increase your bundle size, though tree-shaking can help mitigate this.

RxJS is particularly powerful for applications dealing with complex streams of asynchronous events, such as real-time data, user interactions, or when coordinating multiple async operations. It's widely used in frameworks like Angular and can be a game-changer for managing application state and side effects in large-scale applications.
