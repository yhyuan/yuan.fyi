### Phaser 3

Phaser stands as the most popular HTML5 game framework, with a massive community and extensive documentation. Released in 2013 and now in its third major version, Phaser has proven itself as a reliable choice for developers of all skill levels.

**Architecture and Features**

Phaser 3 uses a scene-based architecture where games are composed of multiple scenes (menu, gameplay, game over, etc.). It includes a comprehensive physics system with both Arcade Physics for simple games and Matter.js integration for complex physics simulations. The framework provides built-in support for sprites, animations, particles, tilemaps, audio, and input handling.

**Performance and Rendering**

The framework uses WebGL for rendering with automatic Canvas fallback, ensuring broad compatibility. Its batching system and texture atlases help optimize draw calls, making it capable of handling hundreds of sprites simultaneously on modern devices.

**Best Use Cases**
- Mid to large-scale 2D games
- Projects requiring robust physics
- Games targeting both desktop and mobile
- Educational projects (due to excellent documentation)

**Code Example**
```javascript
class GameScene extends Phaser.Scene {
    create() {
        this.player = this.physics.add.sprite(100, 450, 'player');
        this.player.setBounce(0.2);
        this.player.setCollideWorldBounds(true);
        
        this.cursors = this.input.keyboard.createCursorKeys();
    }
    
    update() {
        if (this.cursors.left.isDown) {
            this.player.setVelocityX(-160);
        } else if (this.cursors.right.isDown) {
            this.player.setVelocityX(160);
        } else {
            this.player.setVelocityX(0);
        }
    }
}
```

### PixiJS

PixiJS focuses purely on rendering, making it the fastest 2D renderer in the JavaScript ecosystem. Unlike full game frameworks, Pixi provides the visual layer while leaving game logic implementation to the developer.

**Architecture and Features**

Pixi uses a display list architecture similar to Flash, making it intuitive for developers with ActionScript backgrounds. It excels at rendering thousands of sprites through advanced batching, supports filters and shaders, and provides excellent texture management.

**Performance and Rendering**

Built specifically for WebGL with Canvas fallback, PixiJS achieves unmatched rendering performance. Its sprite batching, multi-texture rendering, and advanced culling make it ideal for particle-heavy or visually intensive games.

**Best Use Cases**
- Visually intensive games with many sprites
- Projects requiring custom shader effects
- Games where you want full control over architecture
- Integration with existing web applications

**Code Example**
```javascript
const app = new PIXI.Application({ width: 800, height: 600 });
document.body.appendChild(app.view);

const sprite = PIXI.Sprite.from('player.png');
sprite.anchor.set(0.5);
sprite.x = app.screen.width / 2;
sprite.y = app.screen.height / 2;

app.stage.addChild(sprite);

app.ticker.add((delta) => {
    sprite.rotation += 0.01 * delta;
});
```

### Three.js (2D Mode)

While primarily a 3D library, Three.js can create sophisticated 2D games using orthographic cameras. This approach provides unique advantages for 2D games that benefit from 3D capabilities.

**Architecture and Features**

Three.js uses a scene graph architecture with cameras, lights, and meshes. For 2D games, you work with PlaneGeometry and orthographic cameras, but gain access to 3D transformations, advanced lighting, and post-processing effects.

**Performance and Rendering**

Leveraging WebGL exclusively, Three.js offers excellent performance for complex visual effects. However, it has more overhead than dedicated 2D renderers for simple sprite-based games.

**Best Use Cases**
- 2.5D games with depth effects
- Games requiring advanced visual effects
- Projects that might expand to 3D
- Particle systems with 3D transformations

### p5.js

Born from the Processing community, p5.js prioritizes accessibility and creative coding. It's designed for artists, designers, and beginners, offering a gentle learning curve.

**Architecture and Features**

p5.js uses a sketch-based approach with setup() and draw() functions. It provides intuitive drawing commands, built-in math utilities, and easy event handling. While simpler than game-focused frameworks, it includes basic collision detection and vector math.

**Performance and Rendering**

Using Canvas API by default with WebGL mode available, p5.js isn't optimized for high-performance games. It's suitable for simpler games, prototypes, and educational projects.

**Best Use Cases**
- Educational games
- Rapid prototyping
- Artistic/experimental games
- Projects by beginners or non-programmers

**Code Example**
```javascript
let x = 100;
let y = 100;

function setup() {
    createCanvas(800, 600);
}

function draw() {
    background(220);
    
    if (keyIsDown(LEFT_ARROW)) x -= 5;
    if (keyIsDown(RIGHT_ARROW)) x += 5;
    if (keyIsDown(UP_ARROW)) y -= 5;
    if (keyIsDown(DOWN_ARROW)) y += 5;
    
    circle(x, y, 50);
}
```

### Konva.js

Originally designed for interactive graphics and data visualization, Konva.js has found a niche in UI-heavy games and interactive applications.

**Architecture and Features**

Konva uses a layer-based architecture similar to image editing software. It excels at handling complex shapes, hit detection, and event handling. The framework provides excellent support for dragging, dropping, and transforming objects.

**Performance and Rendering**

Using Canvas API with intelligent redraw regions, Konva optimizes for interactive rather than continuous animation. It's efficient for board games and puzzle games but less suitable for action games.

**Best Use Cases**
- Board games and card games
- Puzzle games
- Educational interactive content
- Games with complex UI requirements

### CreateJS

The CreateJS suite (EaselJS, TweenJS, SoundJS, PreloadJS) provides a Flash-like development experience in JavaScript. It's particularly popular among developers transitioning from Flash.

**Architecture and Features**

EaselJS uses a display list similar to Flash, making it familiar for ActionScript developers. The modular approach allows you to use only needed components. It provides good animation support through TweenJS and integrated asset management.

**Performance and Rendering**

Built on Canvas API, CreateJS offers decent performance for moderate complexity games. While not as fast as WebGL-based solutions, it provides reliable cross-browser compatibility.

**Best Use Cases**
- Projects migrating from Flash
- Games requiring complex animations
- Educational content
- Banner ads and interactive media

### Matter.js

While primarily a physics engine, Matter.js deserves mention for physics-based games. It can be used standalone or integrated with rendering libraries like p5.js or PixiJS.

**Architecture and Features**

Matter.js provides a comprehensive 2D physics engine with rigid body dynamics, collision detection, and constraint systems. It handles complex physics scenarios including compound bodies, sleeping bodies, and various joint types.

**Best Use Cases**
- Physics puzzle games
- Simulations
- Games where physics is the core mechanic
- Integration with other rendering libraries

### Performance Comparison

When choosing a framework, performance characteristics matter:

**Rendering Performance (sprites/frame at 60 FPS)**
- PixiJS: 10,000+ sprites
- Phaser 3: 5,000-8,000 sprites
- Three.js (2D): 5,000-7,000 sprites
- CreateJS: 1,000-3,000 sprites
- p5.js: 500-1,500 sprites
- Konva.js: 500-2,000 shapes

**Memory Usage**
- p5.js: Lowest footprint
- PixiJS: Moderate
- Phaser 3: Moderate to high
- Three.js: Highest
