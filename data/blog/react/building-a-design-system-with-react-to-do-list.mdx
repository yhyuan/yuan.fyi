### Introduction

This to-do list covers the entire process of building a React design system - from initial planning through launch and ongoing maintenance. A few key points to keep in mind:

1. **Start with foundations**: Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) form the building blocks of your entire system.

2. **Document as you build**: Documentation is crucial for adoption - consider using Storybook which provides interactive examples.

3. **Focus on accessibility**: Building accessibility in from the start is much easier than retrofitting it later.

4. **Involve stakeholders early**: Getting feedback from the teams who will use your design system helps ensure it meets their needs.

5. **Plan for governance**: Establish how decisions about the design system will be made and how contributors can participate.

# Building a Design System with React: To-Do List

## 1. Research & Planning
- [ ] Define project scope and goals
- [ ] Research existing design systems for inspiration (Material UI, Chakra, Ant Design)
- [ ] Identify your target audience and their needs
- [ ] Define the core design principles and values
- [ ] Assemble your team (designers, developers, product managers)
- [ ] Set up a communication plan for team collaboration
- [ ] Choose versioning strategy and release cadence

## 2. Visual Design Foundation
- [ ] Create a mood board for visual direction
- [ ] Design color palette (primary, secondary, accent, neutrals)
- [ ] Define typography system (font families, sizes, weights, line heights)
- [ ] Create spacing system (consistent spacing units)
- [ ] Design elevation/shadow system
- [ ] Establish border radius and border width standards
- [ ] Define icon style guidelines and grid
- [ ] Create basic layout and grid system
- [ ] Document all design tokens

## 3. Technical Setup
- [ ] Initialize React project (Create React App, Next.js, Vite)
- [ ] Set up version control (Git repository)
- [ ] Choose component library architecture approach (atomic design?)
- [ ] Set up styling solution (CSS-in-JS, CSS Modules, Sass)
- [ ] Configure design token system (JSON, CSS variables)
- [ ] Set up build and bundling configuration
- [ ] Configure linting and code formatting (ESLint, Prettier)
- [ ] Choose testing frameworks (Jest, React Testing Library)
- [ ] Set up continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD)

## 4. Core Components Development
- [ ] Design and develop primitive components:
  - [ ] Button (variants, sizes, states)
  - [ ] Typography components (headings, paragraphs, etc.)
  - [ ] Layout components (Grid, Box, Stack, etc.)
  - [ ] Form elements (Input, Select, Checkbox, Radio, etc.)
  - [ ] Icons system
  - [ ] Modal/Dialog
  - [ ] Tooltip
  - [ ] Dropdown/Menu
  - [ ] Cards
  - [ ] Navigation components
- [ ] Write tests for all components
- [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG standards)
- [ ] Add proper component documentation

## 5. Advanced Components
- [ ] Design and develop composite components:
  - [ ] Data tables
  - [ ] Date pickers
  - [ ] Autocomplete
  - [ ] File upload components
  - [ ] Charts and data visualization components
  - [ ] Navigation patterns (tabs, breadcrumbs, etc.)
  - [ ] Pagination
  - [ ] Notifications/alerts system
- [ ] Create component composition guidelines
- [ ] Document recommended patterns and anti-patterns

## 6. Documentation & Design System Website
- [ ] Choose documentation tool (Storybook, Docz, custom solution)
- [ ] Create component API documentation
- [ ] Write usage guidelines for each component
- [ ] Add code examples
- [ ] Document design principles and brand guidelines
- [ ] Create getting started guide for new developers
- [ ] Document contribution guidelines
- [ ] Set up search functionality
- [ ] Create interactive playground for components

## 7. Tooling & Integration
- [ ] Create design tokens export for design tools (Figma, Sketch)
- [ ] Set up design-to-code workflow
- [ ] Create Figma/Sketch component library matching code components
- [ ] Develop npm package for easy installation
- [ ] Set up semantic versioning
- [ ] Create migration guides for version updates

## 8. Quality Assurance
- [ ] Set up automated visual regression testing
- [ ] Conduct cross-browser testing
- [ ] Perform accessibility audit (automated and manual)
- [ ] Test responsive behavior across devices
- [ ] Conduct performance testing
- [ ] Get feedback from potential users

## 9. Launch & Maintenance
- [ ] Create launch plan and communication strategy
- [ ] Prepare onboarding materials for teams
- [ ] Release stable version
- [ ] Set up feedback collection system
- [ ] Establish governance process for changes and additions
- [ ] Plan regular maintenance schedule
- [ ] Create roadmap for future development

## 10. Continuous Improvement
- [ ] Set up analytics to track component usage
- [ ] Establish regular design system team meetings
- [ ] Plan user research to evaluate effectiveness
- [ ] Create process for contribution from other teams
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Stay updated with React ecosystem changes
- [ ] Regularly review and update documentation
