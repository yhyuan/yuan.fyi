#### Overview

##### Vite

- Created by Evan You (creator of Vue.js)
- Built on top of esbuild (for dev) and Rollup (for prod)
- Focus on developer experience and fast HMR
- Language: TypeScript/JavaScript

##### Rspack

- Created by ByteDance
- Built in Rust
- Webpack-compatible API
- Focus on build performance and compatibility
- Language: Rust

#### Key Differences

##### 1. Architecture and Performance

###### Vite

```javascript
// vite.config.js
export default {
  build: {
    target: 'esnext',
    minify: 'esbuild',
  },
}
```

- Uses native ES modules during development
- Two-phase approach: dev (esbuild) and build (Rollup)
- No bundling in development
- Very fast cold starts

###### Rspack

```javascript
// rspack.config.js
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  builtins: {
    minifyOptions: {
      passes: 2,
    },
  },
}
```

- Single bundler approach
- Written in Rust for maximum performance
- Bundling in both development and production
- Extremely fast builds

##### 2. Development Experience

###### Vite

- Instant server start
- Lightning-fast HMR
- Rich plugin ecosystem
- Built-in features like CSS modules, PostCSS

```javascript
// vite.config.js
export default {
  plugins: [react()],
  css: {
    modules: {
      localsConvention: 'camelCase',
    },
  },
}
```

###### Rspack

- Fast server start
- Webpack-compatible plugins
- Growing ecosystem
- Native support for common features

```javascript
// rspack.config.js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

##### 3. Configuration and Migration

###### Vite

- Simple, modern configuration
- Less configuration needed out of the box
- May require changes when migrating from Webpack

```javascript
// vite.config.js
export default {
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': '/src',
    },
  },
  server: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': 'http://localhost:3000',
    },
  },
}
```

###### Rspack

- Webpack-like configuration
- Easy migration from Webpack projects
- More configuration options

```javascript
// rspack.config.js
module.exports = {
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'),
    },
  },
  devServer: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': 'http://localhost:3000',
    },
  },
}
```

| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Hot Module Replacement | ✅ Fast           | ✅ Very Fast      |
| CSS Modules            | ✅ Built-in       | ✅ Built-in       |
| TypeScript Support     | ✅ Native         | ✅ Native         |
| JSX Support            | ✅ Built-in       | ✅ Built-in       |
| Code Splitting         | ✅ Advanced       | ✅ Basic          |
| Legacy Browser Support | ✅ Via plugins    | ✅ Built-in       |
| Watch Mode             | ✅ Very fast      | ✅ Extremely fast |
| Plugin System          | ✅ Rich ecosystem | ⚠️ Growing        |
| Webpack Compatibility  | ❌ Limited        | ✅ High           |

##### 5. Build Performance Comparison

###### Cold Start Time

- Vite: < 300ms
- Rspack: < 200ms

###### HMR Update Time

- Vite: ~50ms
- Rspack: ~20ms

###### Production Build Time (Large Project)

- Vite: Minutes
- Rspack: Seconds to minutes

#### Use Cases

##### When to Choose Vite

1. New projects with modern architecture
2. Projects requiring extensive plugin customization
3. Development-focused workflows
4. Projects using Vue.js

Example Vite setup:

```javascript
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: {
          vendor: ['react', 'react-dom'],
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

##### When to Choose Rspack

1. Large-scale applications
2. Projects migrating from Webpack
3. Performance-critical builds
4. Projects requiring Webpack compatibility

Example Rspack setup:

```javascript
// rspack.config.js
module.exports = {
  entry: {
    main: './src/index.js',
  },
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      chunks: 'all',
    },
  },
  builtins: {
    react: {
      development: true,
    },
  },
}
```
