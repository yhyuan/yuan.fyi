## Use a macro to change *all* pictures change their Wrap Text with In line with Text at once

If you’re okay using a tiny bit of VBA, you *can* change all pictures in the document in one shot:

1. Press **Alt + F11** to open the **VBA editor**.

2. Click **Insert → Module**.

3. Paste this code:

   ```vba
   Sub AllPicturesInlineWithText()
       Dim shp As InlineShape
       Dim shpFloat As Shape

       ' Convert floating Shapes to InlineShapes
       For Each shpFloat In ActiveDocument.Shapes
           ' Convert only if it's a picture or similar
           If shpFloat.Type = msoPicture Or shpFloat.Type = msoLinkedPicture Or shpFloat.Type = msoLinkedOLEObject Or shpFloat.Type = msoOLEControlObject Then
               shpFloat.ConvertToInlineShape
           End If
       Next shpFloat

       ' Ensure all InlineShapes are treated as inline (they already are, but we loop anyway)
       For Each shp In ActiveDocument.InlineShapes
           ' Nothing else needed – inline shapes are already "In line with text"
           ' You could adjust size/other properties here if desired
       Next shp
   End Sub
   ```

4. Close the editor.

5. Back in Word, press **Alt + F8**, choose `AllPicturesInlineWithText`, and click **Run**.

What this does:

* Any **floating** images (those with other wrap styles) are turned into **inline** images.
* Inline images are, by definition, **In line with text**.

> ⚠️ Before running a macro, make a backup copy of your document, just in case.
