Here's how to split transaction creation, signing, and broadcasting across different computers:
You need to start bitcoind.

```bash
bitcoind -conf="C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Bitcoin\bitcoin.conf" -datadir="D:\Bitcoin" -printtoconsole
```

1. On Computer 1 (Create unsigned transaction):

```bash
bitcoin-cli -conf="C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Bitcoin\bitcoin.conf" createrawtransaction '[{"txid":"YOUR_TXID","vout":0}]' '{"RECIPIENT_ADDRESS":0.1}'
```

2. On Computer 2 (Sign transaction):

```bash
bitcoin-cli -conf="C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Bitcoin\bitcoin.conf" signrawtransactionwithkey "UNSIGNED_HEX" '["PRIVATE_KEY"]'
```

3. On Computer 3 (Broadcast):

```bash
bitcoin-cli -conf="C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Bitcoin\bitcoin.conf" sendrawtransaction "SIGNED_HEX"
```

Key points:

- Computer 2 needs private keys
- Copy hex strings between computers securely
- Verify transaction details before broadcasting
- Fees must be included in createrawtransaction
