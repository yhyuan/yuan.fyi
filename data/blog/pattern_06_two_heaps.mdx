### Introduction

This pattern aims to quickly calculate the median value of a data stream. To achieve this, we use two heaps: a Min Heap and a Max Heap. The Min Heap stores the larger half of the values, while the Max Heap stores the smaller half. If the total number of elements is odd, the Min Heap will contain one more element than the Max Heap.

With these two heaps properly maintained, calculating the median becomes straightforward. If the count of elements is even, we take the minimum value from the Min Heap and the maximum value from the Max Heap, and compute their average as the median. If the count is odd, the median is simply the top element of the Min Heap.

Here's how we maintain these two heaps:

1. **Insertion:** Compare the new number with the top of the Min Heap. If it's larger or if the heaps are empty, push it to the Min Heap. Otherwise, push the number to the Max Heap.
2. **Balancing:** We then balance the elements between the two heaps. If the difference in size between the heaps is 0 or 1, we leave them as is. However, if the Min Heap has fewer elements than the Max Heap, we pop an element from the Max Heap and push it into the Min Heap. Conversely, if the Min Heap has more elements than the Max Heap, we pop an element from the Min Heap and push it into the Max Heap.

By following these steps, we can efficiently maintain the heaps and calculate the median value of the data stream.

Python Code:

```Python
import heapq

class MedianFinder:

    def __init__(self):
        self.maxHeap = []
        self.minHeap = []
        self.count = 0

    def balance(self):
        if len(self.minHeap) == len(self.maxHeap) or len(self.minHeap) == len(self.maxHeap) + 1:
            return
        if len(self.minHeap) < len(self.maxHeap):
            val = heappop(self.maxHeap)
            heappush(self.minHeap, -val)
        if len(self.minHeap) > len(self.maxHeap) + 1:
            val = heappop(self.minHeap)
            heappush(self.maxHeap, -val)
        return

    def addNum(self, num: int) -> None:
        if len(self.minHeap) == 0 or num > self.minHeap[0]: # larger value
            heappush(self.minHeap, num)
        else:
            heappush(self.maxHeap, -num)
        self.count += 1
        self.balance()

    def findMedian(self) -> float:
        if self.count % 2 == 0:
            return (self.minHeap[0] + (-self.maxHeap[0])) * 0.5
        return self.minHeap[0]
```

TypeScript Code

### 1.Two Heaps Problems

#### 295. Find Median from Data Stream[Hard]

The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

For example, for arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3.
For example, for arr = [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
Implement the MedianFinder class:

MedianFinder() initializes the MedianFinder object.
void addNum(int num) adds the integer num from the data stream to the data structure.
double findMedian() returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

If all integer numbers from the stream are in the range [0, 100], how would you optimize your solution?
If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are in the range [0, 100], how would you optimize your solution?

```TypeScript
// Check Introduction section
```

If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are in the range [0, 100], how would you optimize your solution?
use freq to count the number frequency. It will decrease the time of the calculation of mean to O(1).

```TypeScript
class MedianFinder {
    private freq: number[];
    private smallCount: number;
    private largeCount: number;
    constructor() {
        this.freq = Array(101).fill(0);
        this.smallCount = 0;
        this.largeCount = 0;
    }

    addNum(num: number): void {
        if (num >= 0 && num <= 100) {
            this.freq[num] += 1;
            return;
        }
        if (num < 0) {
            this.smallCount += 1;
            return;
        }
        this.largeCount += 1;
    }

    findMedian(): number {
        const totalCount = this.smallCount + this.largeCount + this.freq.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0);
        const middlePosition = Math.floor(totalCount / 2);

        let count = this.smallCount;
        for (let i = 0; i < this.freq.length; i++) {
            count += this.freq[i];
            if (count > middlePosition) {
                return i;
            } else if (count === middlePosition && totalCount % 2 === 0) {
                // If total count is even and we're exactly at the middle,
                // we need to find the next non-zero frequency
                for (let j = i + 1; j < this.freq.length; j++) {
                    if (this.freq[j] > 0) {
                        return (i + j) / 2;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // This should never happen if the input is valid
        throw new Error("Invalid input: unable to calculate median");
    }
}
```

#### 480. Sliding Window Median[Hard]

The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle values.

For examples, if arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3.
For examples, if arr = [1,2,3,4], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. There is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the median array for each window in the original array. Answers within 10-5 of the actual value will be accepted.

**Solution:** Similar to problem 295, *Find Median from Data Stream*, we can use two heaps to solve this problem. The key difference is that we also need to handle the removal of elements from the left side of the sliding window.

```TypeScript
function medianSlidingWindow(nums: number[], k: number): number[] {
  if (k === 1) {
    return nums;
  }
  const n = nums.length;
  const ans = [];
  const medianFinder: MedianFinder = new MedianFinder();
  Array(k)
    .fill(0)
    .forEach((_, i) => medianFinder.addNum(nums[i]));
  ans.push(medianFinder.findMedian());
  nums.forEach((num, i) => {
    if (i + k < n) {
      medianFinder.addNum(nums[i + k]);
      medianFinder.deleteNum(nums[i]);
      ans.push(medianFinder.findMedian());
    }
  });
  return ans;
}
```

#### 502. IPO[Hard]

Suppose LeetCode will start its IPO soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects.

You are given n projects where the ith project has a pure profit profits[i] and a minimum capital of capital[i] is needed to start it.

Initially, you have w capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

Pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and return the final maximized capital.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

**Solution:** We start by sorting the capital array along with its indices. Concurrently, we create a max heap for the profits, also indexed.

We then add all projects where `capital[i] <= w` to the max heap. From this heap, we extract the project with the maximum profit and update the current capital with this profit.

This process is repeated until we have completed `k` projects.

This solution uses only one heap.

```TypeScript
function findMaximizedCapital(k: number, w: number, profits: number[], capital: number[]): number {
    const n = capital.length;
    const capitalIndices: [number, number][] = capital.map((cap, index) => [cap, index]);
    capitalIndices.sort((a, b) => {
        if (a[0] !== b[0]) return a[0] - b[0];
        return a[1] - b[1];
    }); // sort it with capital and index

    const profitsIndices: Heap<[number, number]> = new Heap<[number, number]>((a: [number, number], b: [number, number]) => {
        if (a[0] !== b[0]) {
            return b[0] - a[0]; // Max Heap
        }
        return a[1] - b[1];
    });

    let j = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        // Add all project with less than w capital to the profitsIndices
        while (j < n && capitalIndices[j][0] <= w) {
            const projectIndex = capitalIndices[j][1];
            profitsIndices.insert([profits[projectIndex], projectIndex]);
            j += 1;
        }
        if (profitsIndices.size() === 0) {
            return w;
        }
        // Pick the one with largest profit.
        const [profit, _] = profitsIndices.extract()!
        w += profit;
    }
    return w;
}
```

### 2.Top K Element Problems

#### 215.Kth Largest Element in an Array[Medium]

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.

Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Can you solve it without sorting?

**Solution:** Create a min heap of size `K` to store the largest `K` elements. The root of the heap will be the smallest of these `K` elements. When a new element is greater than the root, insert this element into the heap and remove the root to keep the heap size at `K`.

```Python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Create a min-heap with the first k elements
        heap = nums[:k]
        heapq.heapify(heap)

        # Process the remaining elements
        for num in nums[k:]:
            if num > heap[0]:
                # Or heapq.heappushpop(heap, num)
                heapq.heappop(heap)
                heapq.heappush(heap, nums[i])

        # The root of the heap is the kth largest element
        return heap[0]
```

```TypeScript
function findKthLargest(nums: number[], k: number): number {
  const heap = new Heap((a: number, b: number) => a - b);
  for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    heap.insert(nums[i]);
  }
  const n = nums.length;
  for (let i = k; i < n; i++) {
    if (heap.peek() < nums[i]) {
      heap.extract();
      heap.insert(nums[i]);
    }
  }
  return heap.peek();
}
```

#### 973.K Closest Point to Origin[Medium]

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., √(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

**Solution:** Insert the distance and coordinates (x, y) into a max heap. If the heap size exceeds `K`, remove the elements from the heap. The remaining points in the max heap will be the final results.

```Python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Define a lambda function to calculate the squared Euclidean distance
        distance = lambda point: point[0]**2 + point[1]**2

        # Create a max-heap using negative distances to store the k closest points
        max_heap = []

        for point in points:
            dist = distance(point)
            # If heap size is less than k, push the current point
            if len(max_heap) < k:
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-dist, point))
            else:
                # If the current distance is smaller than the farthest point in the heap
                if dist < -max_heap[0][0]:
                    # Replace the farthest point with the current point
                    heapq.heappushpop(max_heap, (-dist, point))

        # Extract the points from the heap
        return [point for _, point in max_heap]
```

#### 1167.Minimum Cost to Connect Sticks[Medium]

You have some number of sticks with positive integer lengths. These lengths are given as an array sticks, where sticks[i] is the length of the ith stick.

You can connect any two sticks of lengths x and y into one stick by paying a cost of x + y. You must connect all the sticks until there is only one stick remaining.

Return the minimum cost of connecting all the given sticks into one stick in this way.

**Solution:** Use a min heap to repeatedly find and connect the two smallest sticks, then push the combined stick back into the heap. Continue this process until only one stick remains in the heap. Throughout, keep track of the cost and update the final result accordingly.

```Python
import heapq
class Solution:
    def connectSticks(self, sticks: List[int]) -> int:
        heapq.heapify(sticks)
        ans = 0
        while (len(sticks) > 1):
            s1 = heapq.heappop(sticks)
            s2 = heapq.heappop(sticks)
            ans += (s1 + s2)
            heapq.heappush(sticks, s1 + s2)
        return ans
```

#### 347.Top K Frequent Elements[Medium]

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

**Solution:** Use a min heap to store tuples of `(freq, num)` for the top K frequent elements. If the heap exceeds size K, remove the top element to maintain the desired size.

```Python
import heapq
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each element
        freq_map = Counter(nums)

        # Step 2: Use a min-heap to keep track of the top k frequent elements
        min_heap = []

        for num, freq in freq_map.items():
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, (freq, num))
            if len(min_heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(min_heap)

        # Step 3: Extract the elements from the heap
        result = []
        while min_heap:
            result.append(heapq.heappop(min_heap)[1])

        return result
```

#### 451.Sort Characters by Frequency[Medium]

Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

**Solution:** Use a max heap to store tuples of `(-freq, num)` for the frequency and elements.

```Python
import heapq
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each character
        freq_map = Counter(s)

        # Step 2: Use a max-heap to keep track of characters sorted by their frequencies
        max_heap = [(-freq, char) for char, freq in freq_map.items()]
        heapq.heapify(max_heap)

        # Step 3: Construct the sorted string
        result = ""
        while max_heap:
            freq, char = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            result += char * (-freq)

        return result
```

#### 703.Kth Largest Element in a Stream[Easy]

Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Implement KthLargest class:

KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of integers nums.
int add(int val) Appends the integer val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.

**Solution:** Use a min heap to store  the top K Largest elements. If the heap exceeds size K, remove the top element to maintain the desired size.

```Python
import heapq

class KthLargest:

    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        self.k = k
        # min heap
        self.heap = []
        for num in nums:
            heapq.heappush(self.heap, num)
            if (len(self.heap) > self.k):
                heapq.heappop(self.heap)

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        heapq.heappush(self.heap, val)
        if (len(self.heap) > self.k):
            heapq.heappop(self.heap)
        return self.heap[0]
```

#### 1481.Least Number of Unique Integers after K Removals[Medium]

Given an array of integers arr and an integer k. Find the least number of unique integers after removing exactly k elements.

```Python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def findLeastNumOfUniqueInts(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each integer
        freq_map = Counter(arr)
        # Step 2: Sort the integers by frequency in non-increasing order
        sorted_integers = sorted(freq_map.keys(), key=lambda x: (freq_map[x], x))
        # Step 3: Remove the least frequent elements
        count_unique = len(freq_map)
        for num in sorted_integers:
            if k >= freq_map[num]:
                k -= freq_map[num]
                count_unique -= 1
            else:
                break
        # Step 4: Return the number of unique integers remaining
        return count_unique
```

#### Sum of all elements between k1’th and k2’th smallest elements

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-elements-k1th-k2th-smallest-elements/

#### 767.Reorganize String[Medium]

Given a string s, rearrange the characters of s so that any two adjacent characters are not the same.

Return any possible rearrangement of s or return "" if not possible.

```Python
import heapq
from collections import Counter

class Solution:

#### 358.Rearrange String k Distance Apart[Hard]

Given a string s and an integer k, rearrange s such that the same characters are at least distance k from each other. If it is not possible to rearrange the string, return an empty string "".

```Python
import heapq
from collections import Counter, deque

class Solution:
    def rearrangeString(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each character
        freq_map = Counter(s)
        # Step 2: Use a priority queue to store characters based on their frequencies
        max_heap = [(-freq, ch) for ch, freq in freq_map.items()]
        heapq.heapify(max_heap)
        # Initialize the result string
        result = ""
        # Initialize a temporary list to keep track of characters that have been used recently
        temp_list = deque()
        # Step 4: Pop the most frequent character and append it to the result string
        while max_heap:
            freq, ch = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            result += ch
            freq += 1
            # Push the character into the temporary list
            temp_list.append((freq, ch))
            # If the temporary list exceeds k characters, push the characters back into the priority queue
            if len(temp_list) >= k:
                freq, ch = temp_list.popleft()
                if freq < 0:
                    heapq.heappush(max_heap, (freq, ch))
        # If the result string is shorter than the input string, return an empty string
        return "" if len(result) < len(s) else result
```

#### 621.Task Scheduler[Medium]

You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.

​Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.

```Python
import heapq
from collections import Counter, deque

class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0:
            return len(tasks)

        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each task
        task_counts = Counter(tasks)

        # Step 2: Create a max-heap from the task counts (using negative values for max-heap in Python)
        max_heap = [-count for count in task_counts.values()]
        heapq.heapify(max_heap)

        # Step 3: Initialize variables for time tracking and a queue for cooling
        time = 0
        cooldown = deque()  # (next_available_time, task_count)

        while max_heap or cooldown:
            time += 1

            if max_heap:
                current_task_count = heapq.heappop(max_heap) + 1  # decrement the count (since it's negative)
                if current_task_count != 0:
                    cooldown.append((time + n, current_task_count))

            if cooldown and cooldown[0][0] == time:
                _, task_count = cooldown.popleft()
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, task_count)

        return time
```

#### 895.Maximum Frequency Stack[Hard]

Design a stack-like data structure to push elements to the stack and pop the most frequent element from the stack.

Implement the FreqStack class:

- `FreqStack()` constructs an empty frequency stack.
- `void push(int val)` pushes an integer val onto the top of the stack.
- `int pop()` removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.
  - If there is a tie for the most frequent element, the element closest to the stack's top is removed and returned.

```Python
from collections import defaultdict

class FreqStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.freq = defaultdict(int)      # Map to store frequency of elements
        self.group = defaultdict(list)    # Map to store stacks of elements by frequency
        self.maxfreq = 0                  # Variable to keep track of the current max frequency

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        # Increase the frequency count of the element
        self.freq[val] += 1
        f = self.freq[val]
        # If this is the highest frequency so far, update maxfreq
        if f > self.maxfreq:
            self.maxfreq = f
        # Add the element to the stack corresponding to its frequency
        self.group[f].append(val)

    def pop(self) -> int:
        # Pop the most frequent element
        val = self.group[self.maxfreq].pop()
        # Decrease the frequency count of the element
        self.freq[val] -= 1
        # If no elements are left in the current max frequency stack, decrement maxfreq
        if not self.group[self.maxfreq]:
            self.maxfreq -= 1
        return val
```

#### 1046. Last Stone Weight[Easy]

You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with `x <= y`. The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.

Return the weight of the last remaining stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.


```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        heap = list(map(lambda stone: -stone, stones))
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        while (len(heap) > 1):
            stone1 = heapq.heappop(heap)
            stone2 = heapq.heappop(heap)
            if (stone1 != stone2):
                if (stone1 > stone2):
                    heapq.heappush(heap, stone2 - stone1)
                else:
                    heapq.heappush(heap, stone1 - stone2)
        if len(heap) == 0: return 0
        return -heapq.heappop(heap)
```

#### 1337. The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix[Easy]

You are given an m x n binary matrix mat of 1's (representing soldiers) and 0's (representing civilians). The soldiers are positioned in front of the civilians. That is, all the 1's will appear to the left of all the 0's in each row.

A row i is weaker than a row j if one of the following is true:

The number of soldiers in row i is less than the number of soldiers in row j.
Both rows have the same number of soldiers and i < j.
Return the indices of the k weakest rows in the matrix ordered from weakest to strongest.

matrix[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def kWeakestRows(self, mat: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[int]:
        heap = []
        n = len(mat)
        for i in range(n):
            j = 0
            size = 0
            while (j < len(mat[i]) and mat[i][j] == 1):
                j += 1
                size += 1
            heapq.heappush(heap, (size, i))
        ans = []
        for i in range(k):
            (size, index) = heapq.heappop(heap)
            ans.append(index)
        return ans
```

#### 1642. Furthest Building You Can Reach[Medium]

You are given an integer array heights representing the heights of buildings, some bricks, and some ladders.

You start your journey from building 0 and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.

While moving from building i to building i+1 (0-indexed),

If the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you do not need a ladder or bricks.
If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use one ladder or (h[i+1] - h[i]) bricks.
Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.

Explain:
Use a min heap to track the positive differences between the next building and the current building. When it reaches the number of ladder, it will pop out the min value of the difference and use the bricks to solve it. Then, it breaks when the bricks run out.

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def furthestBuilding(self, heights: List[int], bricks: int, ladders: int) -> int:
        n = len(heights)
        heap = []
        for i in range(n - 1):
            diff = heights[i + 1] - heights[i]
            if diff > 0:
                heapq.heappush(heap, diff)
            if len(heap) > ladders:
                bricks -= heapq.heappop(heap)
            if bricks < 0:
                return i
        return n - 1
```

#### 2402. Meeting Rooms III[Hard]

You are given an integer n. There are n rooms numbered from 0 to n - 1.

You are given a 2D integer array meetings where meetings[i] = [starti, endi] means that a meeting will be held during the half-closed time interval [starti, endi). All the values of starti are unique.

Meetings are allocated to rooms in the following manner:

Each meeting will take place in the unused room with the lowest number.
If there are no available rooms, the meeting will be delayed until a room becomes free. The delayed meeting should have the same duration as the original meeting.
When a room becomes unused, meetings that have an earlier original start time should be given the room.
Return the number of the room that held the most meetings. If there are multiple rooms, return the room with the lowest number.

A half-closed interval [a, b) is the interval between a and b including a and not including b.

All the values of starti are unique.

```TypeScript
class Node {
    public end: number;
    public roomId: number;
    constructor(end: number, roomId: number) {
        this.end = end;
        this.roomId = roomId;
    }
}

function mostBooked(n: number, meetings: number[][]): number {
    meetings.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]); // sort by starting time
    // Create a Heap which can find the earlist ending time.
    const minHeap = new MinHeap<Node>((a, b) => {
        if (a.end !== b.end) return a.end - b.end;
        return a.roomId - b.roomId;
    });
    const roomsCount = Array(n).fill(0);
    const roomsStatus = Array(n).fill(false);
    meetings.forEach(meeting => {
        const [start, end] = meeting;
        // Remove all the meetings which have been ended before the starting of current meeting.
        while (minHeap.size() > 0 && minHeap.peek().end <= start) {
            const node = minHeap.extractMin();
            roomsStatus[node.roomId] = false;
        }
        let roomId = -1;
        if (minHeap.size() < n) {
            // Find an available room
            roomId = roomsStatus.findIndex(status => status === false);
            minHeap.insert(new Node(end, roomId));
        } else {
            const node = minHeap.extractMin();
            roomId = node.roomId;
            const newNode = new Node(node.end + end - start, roomId);
            minHeap.insert(newNode);
        }
        roomsCount[roomId] += 1;
        roomsStatus[roomId] = true;
    });
    const maxValue = Math.max(...roomsCount);
    return roomsCount.findIndex(v => v === maxValue);
};
```
