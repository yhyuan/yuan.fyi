Designing a concrete pier foundation for a **16 ft by 24 ft shed** requires consideration of Ontario’s building codes, frost line depths, and load distribution. Here's a recommended layout:

---

### **1. General Considerations for Southern Ontario**

- **Frost Line Depth**: In Southern Ontario, piers must be dug at least **4 feet below ground** to prevent frost heaving.
- **Spacing of Piers**: Typically, piers should be spaced **6–8 feet apart**, depending on the load.
- **Beam and Joist Support**: The piers should support beams, which in turn hold the floor joists.
- **Weight Distribution**: Ensure the load of the shed is evenly distributed across all piers.

---

### **2. Suggested Layout**

For a **16 ft by 24 ft** shed, you’ll need **9 concrete piers**, arranged in a 3x3 grid.

#### **Pier Placement**

- Place piers at **corners**, **midpoints**, and **center** for even load distribution.
- The spacing will be approximately:
  - **8 feet apart** along the 24-ft side (long side).
  - **8 feet apart** along the 16-ft side (short side).

#### **Diagram**

Here's the layout:

```
O---------O---------O (16 ft wide)
|         |         |
|         |         | (8 ft spacing)
O---------O---------O
|         |         |
|         |         |
O---------O---------O (24 ft long)
```

- **O** = Concrete pier location.

---

### **3. Materials and Dimensions**

#### **Concrete Piers:**

- Use **sonotubes** (12-inch diameter) for the piers.
- Depth: Minimum **4 ft below grade** to reach below the frost line.

#### **Beams and Joists:**

- Beams: Use **2x8 or 2x10 pressure-treated lumber**.
- Floor Joists: Use **2x6 or 2x8**, spaced at **16 inches on center**.
- Joist Hangers: Attach joists to the beams using metal hangers for added stability.

#### **Anchoring System:**

- Insert **J-bolts** into the concrete piers to secure the beams.
- Use adjustable **post bases** for leveling.

---

### **4. Construction Steps**

1. **Mark and Dig Holes**:

   - Mark the pier locations based on the layout.
   - Dig holes at least **12 inches wide and 4 feet deep**.

2. **Install Sonotubes**:

   - Place sonotubes into the holes and fill them with concrete.
   - Insert **J-bolts** into the wet concrete to anchor the beams.

3. **Level the Piers**:

   - Ensure all piers are level before the concrete sets.

4. **Install Beams**:

   - Lay beams across the piers and secure them with the anchors.

5. **Attach Joists**:

   - Attach the floor joists perpendicular to the beams using joist hangers.
   - Add blocking between joists for extra stability.

6. **Install Flooring**:
   - Lay down **3/4-inch tongue-and-groove plywood** or similar material for the shed floor.
