        Hi 👋, I’m <strong>Yuan</strong> — a software engineer, technologist, and lifelong learner with a deep curiosity
        about how things work, from the lowest-level hardware to high-level web applications.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <p>
        By profession, I’m a <strong>software engineer</strong> with extensive experience in modern web development.
        I work a lot with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>React / TypeScript / JavaScript</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Frontend architecture &amp; performance</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Design systems and component libraries</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Testing, tooling, and developer experience</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Modern build systems</strong> (Vite, Webpack, Storybook, CI/CD)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I enjoy turning complex requirements into clean, maintainable systems and care deeply about code quality,
        clarity, and long-term sustainability.
      </p>

      <h2>Beyond the Browser</h2>
      <p>
        My interests go well beyond web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m deeply fascinated by <strong>embedded systems and hardware</strong>, especially where software meets the
        physical world. Some areas I actively explore and build in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Microcontrollers</strong> (STM32, Rust, Embassy-RS)</li>
        <li><strong>Secure hardware and cryptography</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Bitcoin &amp; cold-wallet design</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Electronics, PCBs, and DIY hardware projects</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Low-level systems, protocols, and performance</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I enjoy understanding systems end-to-end — not just how to use them, but how they are designed, constrained,
        and optimized.
      </p>

      <h2>Why This Blog Exists</h2>
      <p>
        I created <strong>yuan.fyi</strong> as a place to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Share <strong>what I’m learning</strong>, building, or experimenting with</li>
        <li>Write <strong>clear explanations</strong> for complex technical topics</li>
        <li>Document <strong>design decisions</strong>, trade-offs, and failures</li>
        <li>Think out loud about <strong>technology, engineering, and systems</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some posts may be deep technical dives. Others may be notes, experiments, or reflections. The common theme is
        curiosity and clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        If something here helps you think differently, solve a problem faster, or learn something new — that’s a win.
      </p>

      <h2>How I Think</h2>
      <p>
        A few principles that guide how I work and learn:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Understand fundamentals first</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Prefer simple, explicit designs</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Question assumptions</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Optimize for correctness before cleverness</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Build things to truly understand them</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I believe good engineering is about judgment, not just tools.
      </p>

      <h2>A Bit More Human</h2>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I’m a parent, a hobbyist, and someone who enjoys teaching and learning alongside my kids.
        I believe curiosity is contagious — and worth protecting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks for stopping by.<br />
        If you’re interested in programming, technology, hardware, or thoughtful engineering discussions, you’re in
        the right place.
