### Introduction

TypeScript's type system is one of its most powerful features, and generics are at the heart of writing reusable, type-safe code. While basic generics are relatively straightforward, TypeScript offers a range of advanced generic techniques that can help solve complex typing problems. In this post, we'll explore some of these advanced concepts.

#### 1. Conditional Types

Conditional types allow you to create types that depend on other types. They're defined using a structure similar to ternary operators in JavaScript.

```typescript
type IsArray<T> = T extends any[] ? true : false

type WithArray = IsArray<string[]> // true
type WithoutArray = IsArray<number> // false
```

Conditional types become particularly powerful when combined with infer:

```typescript
type UnpackArray<T> = T extends Array<infer U> ? U : T

type Unpacked1 = UnpackArray<string[]> // string
type Unpacked2 = UnpackArray<number> // number
```

#### 2. Mapped Types

Mapped types allow you to create new types based on old ones by transforming properties.

```typescript
type Readonly<T> = {
  readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P]
}

interface Mutable {
  x: number
  y: string
}

type Immutable = Readonly<Mutable>
// Equivalent to: { readonly x: number; readonly y: string; }
```

You can also remove properties or change their optionality:

```typescript
type Optional<T> = {
  [P in keyof T]?: T[P]
}

type Required<T> = {
  [P in keyof T]-?: T[P]
}
```

#### 3. Template Literal Types

Template literal types allow you to manipulate string-based types:

```typescript
type World = 'world'
type Greeting = `hello ${World}` // "hello world"

type EmailLocaleIDs = 'welcome_email' | 'email_heading'
type FooterLocaleIDs = 'footer_title' | 'footer_sendoff'

type AllLocaleIDs = `${EmailLocaleIDs | FooterLocaleIDs}_id`
// "welcome_email_id" | "email_heading_id" | "footer_title_id" | "footer_sendoff_id"
```

#### 4. Recursive Types

TypeScript allows you to create recursive type aliases, which can be useful for defining tree-like structures:

```typescript
type TreeNode<T> = {
  value: T
  left?: TreeNode<T>
  right?: TreeNode<T>
}

let tree: TreeNode<number> = {
  value: 1,
  left: {
    value: 2,
    left: {
      value: 4,
    },
  },
  right: {
    value: 3,
  },
}
```

#### 5. Higher-Order Types

You can create "higher-order types" that operate on other types, similar to how higher-order functions operate on other functions:

```typescript
type ArrayType<T> = T[]
type StringArray = ArrayType<string> // string[]

type Func<T> = (arg: T) => T
type StringFunc = Func<string> // (arg: string) => string
```

#### 6. Variadic Tuple Types

TypeScript 4.0 introduced variadic tuple types, allowing you to work with tuples of arbitrary length:

```typescript
type Tail<T extends any[]> = T extends [any, ...infer U] ? U : never

type TailResult = Tail<[string, number, boolean]> // [number, boolean]
```

#### 7. Key Remapping in Mapped Types

TypeScript 4.1 added the ability to remap keys in mapped types:

```typescript
type Getters<T> = {
  [K in keyof T as `get${Capitalize<string & K>}`]: () => T[K]
}

interface Person {
  name: string
  age: number
}

type PersonGetters = Getters<Person>
// { getName: () => string; getAge: () => number; }
```

#### 8. Generic Type Inference in Conditional Types

You can use the `infer` keyword to infer types within conditional types:

```typescript
type ReturnType<T> = T extends (...args: any[]) => infer R ? R : any

function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b
}

type AddReturnType = ReturnType<typeof add> // number
```

#### 9. Distributive Conditional Types

Conditional types are distributive over union types:

```typescript
type ToArray<T> = T extends any ? T[] : never

type StrNumBool = string | number | boolean
type StrNumBoolArray = ToArray<StrNumBool> // string[] | number[] | boolean[]
```

#### 10. Indexed Access Types

You can use indexed access types to look up a specific property on another type:

```typescript
type Person = { age: number; name: string; alive: boolean }
type Age = Person['age'] // number

type I1 = Person['age' | 'name'] // string | number

type I2 = Person[keyof Person] // string | number | boolean
```

#### Conclusion

These advanced generic techniques in TypeScript provide powerful tools for creating flexible, reusable, and type-safe code. While they can be complex, mastering these concepts allows you to express intricate type relationships and create highly abstract, yet type-safe libraries and applications.

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. While these techniques are powerful, they can also make your code harder to understand if overused. Always strive for a balance between type safety and code readability.

Happy TypeScripting!
