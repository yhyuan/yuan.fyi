27. **What is Promise chaining? How do you handle errors in a Promise chain?** This tests practical async programming knowledge.

28. **Explain `async`/`await`. How does it relate to Promises? What are the benefits and potential pitfalls?** This tests understanding of syntactic sugar and async patterns.

29. **How do you handle multiple asynchronous operations? Compare `Promise.all()`, `Promise.race()`, `Promise.allSettled()`, and `Promise.any()`.** This tests knowledge of Promise combinators and their use cases.

30. **What are the common pitfalls when using `async`/`await`? How do you handle errors properly?** This reveals practical experience with async code.

31. **Explain the differences between callbacks, Promises, and `async`/`await`. When would you use each?** This tests understanding of the evolution of async patterns.

32. **How would you implement a simple Promise from scratch?** This is an advanced question that tests deep understanding of Promise internals.

33. **What is callback hell, and how do modern async patterns solve it?** This tests awareness of historical problems and their solutions.

## Functions and Functional Programming (Questions 34-40)

34. **Explain the concepts of first-class functions and higher-order functions with examples.** This is fundamental to functional programming in JavaScript.

## Bonus Conceptual Questions (Extra Context)

These questions test deeper understanding of specific areas:

**Event Loop Deep Dive:**
```javascript
console.log('1');
setTimeout(() => console.log('2'), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('3'));
console.log('4');
// What's the output and why?
```

**This Binding Challenge:**
```javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet: function() {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
  delayedGreet: function() {
    setTimeout(function() {
      console.log(this.name);
    }, 1000);
  }
};
obj.delayedGreet(); // What happens and how do you fix it?
```

**Closure Memory:**
```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return {
    increment: () => ++count,
    decrement: () => --count,
    getCount: () => count
  };
}
// Explain the closure and why count is private
```

**Prototype Chain:**
```javascript
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
  console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound`);
};

function Dog(name) {
  Animal.call(this, name);
}
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;
// Explain each line and the resulting prototype chain
```

These 50+ questions comprehensively cover JavaScript from fundamentals through advanced concepts, touching on the language's quirks, modern features, async programming, functional patterns, and practical considerations. They're designed to test not just memorization but genuine understanding of how JavaScript works and how to write effective JavaScript code.
