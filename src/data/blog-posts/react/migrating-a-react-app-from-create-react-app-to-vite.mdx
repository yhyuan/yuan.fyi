### Introduction

Migrating from **Create React App (CRA)** to **Vite** offers several advantages, particularly in terms of development experience and build performance. Here’s a detailed comparison:

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Introduction" />{' '}

### Comparision

##### 1. **Faster Development Server Start-Up**

- **Vite**: Vite's development server is significantly faster than CRA. It uses **esbuild** to pre-bundle dependencies, making the initial start-up almost instantaneous, even for larger projects.
- **CRA**: Uses **Webpack** for development, which can result in slower server start-up times, especially as project size increases.

##### 2. **Better Build Performance**

- **Vite**: Vite leverages **Rollup** for production builds and uses **esbuild** for faster JavaScript transpilation, leading to much faster build times.
- **CRA**: CRA relies on **Webpack** for both development and production, which can be slower, especially for large-scale applications.

##### 3. **On-Demand Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**

- **Vite**: Provides an extremely fast HMR out of the box, updating modules instantly without refreshing the whole page. This speeds up development by reflecting code changes in real-time.
- **CRA**: Supports HMR, but the performance is generally slower compared to Vite due to the underlying Webpack implementation.

##### 4. **Modern JavaScript Support**

- **Vite**: Uses native **ES modules** in the browser for development, which streamlines the bundling process and makes the development server much more efficient.
- **CRA**: Uses a bundler (Webpack) to compile code, which adds overhead and can slow down the development process, especially with larger apps.

##### 5. **Simpler Configuration**

- **Vite**: Offers a more straightforward configuration out of the box. The default `vite.config.js` is easy to extend without complex overrides, making it more user-friendly for customization.
- **CRA**: Customizing Webpack in CRA can be difficult and often requires ejecting the app, which makes the configuration harder to maintain and update.

##### 6. **Support for Modern Features**

- **Vite**: Supports **TypeScript**, **JSX**, and **CSS modules** natively, as well as popular plugins that integrate seamlessly (e.g., PostCSS, Tailwind CSS, etc.). Vite also has better support for advanced features like code-splitting and lazy loading with minimal configuration.
- **CRA**: Also supports these features but can be more challenging to extend or customize, especially if complex configurations are required.

##### 7. **Better Handling of Static Assets**

- **Vite**: Manages static assets efficiently using native **ES module imports**. This leads to faster loading during development and better optimization during production builds.
- **CRA**: Uses Webpack's asset management, which is reliable but can be slower and more cumbersome to manage, especially for large asset-heavy projects.

##### 8. **Improved Dependency Pre-Bundling**

- **Vite**: Uses **esbuild** for pre-bundling dependencies, which drastically speeds up page loads and prevents cold-start performance issues.
- **CRA**: Bundles dependencies using Webpack, which can result in longer start times and more sluggish development performance as the dependency graph grows.

##### 9. **Out-of-the-Box Plugin Ecosystem**

- **Vite**: Has a robust plugin ecosystem with plugins for **React**, **Vue**, **TypeScript**, **PWA support**, and more. These plugins are often easier to integrate and use due to Vite’s modern architecture.
- **CRA**: Extending CRA usually requires custom configuration or ejecting the app, which can make adding new features more complicated.

##### 10. **Support for Modern Tooling**

- **Vite**: Is designed with modern web development tooling in mind and can seamlessly integrate with tools like **Prettier**, **ESLint**, and **Tailwind CSS** without significant configuration.
- **CRA**: Integrates with these tools as well but may require more complex setups for advanced configurations.

##### 11. **Production-Ready Performance**

- **Vite**: The production build process using Rollup ensures that the code is tree-shaken and optimized, resulting in smaller, faster-loading bundles.
- **CRA**: While CRA's production build using Webpack is reliable, it is generally slower to build and may produce slightly larger output compared to Vite’s optimized bundles.

##### 12. **Dynamic Imports and Code Splitting**

- **Vite**: Automatically handles dynamic imports and code-splitting efficiently, which helps with faster load times and reduced initial bundle sizes.
- **CRA**: Supports code splitting, but it is less optimized and may require more configuration for best results.

##### Summary:

**Vite** outshines **CRA** in terms of speed, ease of configuration, modern features, and overall developer experience. It offers:

- Faster development server start-up and HMR
- Better build performance
- Simpler, more flexible configuration
- More modern tooling support and integration

However, **CRA** can still be a good choice for smaller projects or teams already familiar with Webpack. For developers looking for modern performance and development enhancements, **Vite** is a powerful alternative.

#### Steps

Migrating a React app from **Create React App (CRA)** to **Vite** can significantly improve build speed and development performance due to Vite's modern bundling approach. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

##### 1. Create a Vite Project

First, create a new Vite project in a different directory to understand the default structure.

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-vite-app --template react
cd my-vite-app
npm install
```

##### 2. Copy Your Existing Project Files

Copy your `src` directory, `public` directory, and any additional assets from your CRA project to the Vite project.

##### 3. Install Necessary Dependencies

Vite uses `vite` as its core dependency. Ensure that you have installed React and ReactDOM if they weren't already installed:

```bash
npm install react react-dom
npm install -D vite
```

##### 4. Update `package.json` Scripts

Replace the CRA scripts in `package.json` with Vite-specific ones:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview"
}
```

##### 5. Configure `vite.config.js`

Create a `vite.config.js` file if it doesn't already exist or modify the existing one to match your project structure:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  // Add any custom configuration here if needed
})
```

##### 6. Update the Entry Points

Vite expects the entry point to be `index.html` in the root directory. Ensure your `index.html` file has the following:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>React App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Ensure that your `src/main.jsx` (or `main.tsx` if you're using TypeScript) contains the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import App from './App'
import './index.css' // Include your CSS file or adjust as needed

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
)
```

##### 7. Adjust the Import Paths

Vite uses native ES modules, so ensure that any paths using `process.env.PUBLIC_URL`, `require`, or CRA-specific paths (`@/`) are replaced with standard relative imports.

##### 8. Migrate Environment Variables

Vite uses `VITE_` prefix for environment variables. Rename your `.env` variables from `REACT_APP_` to `VITE_`:

```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://example.com
```

Becomes:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://example.com
```

Update your code to use `import.meta.env` instead of `process.env`:

```js
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL)
```

##### 9. Review and Replace Other CRA-Specific Features

- **`react-scripts`**: Remove this dependency as Vite replaces it.
- **`serviceWorker.js`**: If you're using a service worker, refer to the [Vite PWA plugin](https://vite-plugin-pwa.netlify.app/) to configure it.
- **CSS Modules**: Vite supports CSS modules out of the box, so no additional configuration is needed.

##### 10. Start Your Development Server

Run your new Vite development server to ensure everything works:

```bash
npm run dev
```

##### 11. Test Your Build

Build and preview your app to ensure it works as expected:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

##### 12. Additional Considerations

- **Custom Aliases**: If you used aliases in CRA (e.g., `@` for `src/`), set them up in `vite.config.js`:

  ```js
  import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
  import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
  import path from 'path'

  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [react()],
    resolve: {
      alias: {
        '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
      },
    },
  })
  ```

- **Linting and Formatting**: Ensure that your ESLint and Prettier configurations work with Vite, adjusting any configurations as needed.

##### Final Thoughts

Migrating from CRA to Vite can streamline your development workflow, resulting in faster build times and a more responsive development server. By following these steps, you should be able to transition smoothly to a Vite-based setup.

# Migrating from Create React App to Vite

This guide will walk you through the process of migrating your Create React App (CRA) project to Vite. Vite offers significantly faster development server startup and hot module replacement (HMR).

## Step 1: Create a New Package.json

First, create a backup of your existing `package.json`, then modify it to remove CRA-specific dependencies and add Vite ones:

```json
{
  "name": "your-app-name",
  "private": true,
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc && vite build",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext ts,tsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "test": "vitest"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
    // Keep other non-CRA dependencies
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@testing-library/react": "^14.0.0",
    "@types/react": "^18.2.15",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.2.7",
    "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin": "^6.0.0",
    "@typescript-eslint/parser": "^6.0.0",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.0.3",
    "eslint": "^8.45.0",
    "eslint-plugin-react-hooks": "^4.6.0",
    "eslint-plugin-react-refresh": "^0.4.3",
    "jsdom": "^22.1.0",
    "typescript": "^5.0.2",
    "vite": "^4.4.5",
    "vitest": "^0.34.0"
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Create Vite Configuration

Create a new file `vite.config.ts` in your project root:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import path from 'path'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
    },
  },
  server: {
    port: 3000, // Match CRA's default port
    open: true, // Open browser on server start
  },
  build: {
    outDir: 'build', // Match CRA's default build output directory
    sourcemap: true,
  },
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: 'jsdom',
    setupFiles: './src/setupTests.ts',
    css: true,
  },
})
```

## Step 3: Update Environment Variables

Rename `.env` files by replacing `REACT_APP_` with `VITE_`:

```bash
# Before (.env)
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.example.com

# After (.env)
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

Update environment variable references in your code:

```typescript
// Before
console.log(process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL)

// After
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL)
```

## Step 4: Update TypeScript Configuration

Update or create `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "useDefineForClassFields": true,
    "lib": ["ES2020", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"],
    "module": "ESNext",
    "skipLibCheck": true,

    /* Bundler mode */
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "jsx": "react-jsx",

    /* Linting */
    "strict": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "noFallthrough": true,

    /* Paths */
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["src/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["src"],
  "references": [{ "path": "./tsconfig.node.json" }]
}
```

Create `tsconfig.node.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "composite": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "allowSyntaxusage": true
  },
  "include": ["vite.config.ts"]
}
```

## Step 5: Update HTML Template

Move `public/index.html` to `index.html` in the root directory and update it:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.ico" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Your App Name</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Step 6: Update Entry Point

Rename `src/index.tsx` to `src/main.tsx`:

```typescript
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App'
import './index.css'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

## Step 7: Update Testing Setup

If you're using Jest, switch to Vitest. Create `src/setupTests.ts`:

```typescript
import '@testing-library/jest-dom'
import { expect, afterEach } from 'vitest'
import { cleanup } from '@testing-library/react'
import matchers from '@testing-library/jest-dom/matchers'

// Extend Vitest's expect method with methods from react-testing-library
expect.extend(matchers)

// Run cleanup after each test case (e.g. clearing jsdom)
afterEach(() => {
  cleanup()
})
```

Update your test files:

```typescript
// Before
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import App from './App'

test('renders learn react link', () => {
  render(<App />)
  const linkElement = screen.getByText(/learn react/i)
  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument()
})

// After
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import App from './App'

describe('App', () => {
  it('renders learn react link', () => {
    render(<App />)
    const linkElement = screen.getByText(/learn react/i)
    expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
```

## Step 8: Update Static Assets Imports

Update static asset imports to use the new Vite syntax:

```typescript
// Before
import logo from './logo.svg'

// After
import logo from './assets/logo.svg'
```

## Step 9: Update CSS Modules

If you're using CSS Modules, update the import syntax:

```typescript
// Before
import styles from './Button.module.css'

// After (no change needed, Vite supports this syntax)
import styles from './Button.module.css'
```

## Step 10: Install Dependencies and Test

Install the new dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Public Path Issues

If you have assets in the public directory, move them to the root public directory and update references:

```typescript
// Before
<img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/logo.png'} />

// After
<img src="/logo.png" />
```

### 2. Proxy Configuration

If you're using the proxy feature in CRA, update it in `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  server: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'http://localhost:3001',
        changeOrigin: true,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

### 3. Absolute Imports

Update your path aliases in both `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json`:

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
resolve: {
  alias: {
    '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
  },
}

// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Performance Improvements

After migrating to Vite, you might notice:

- Faster development server startup
- Quicker Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- Improved build times

To further optimize your Vite setup:

1. Enable build caching:

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    cache: true,
    // Minimize only in production
    minify: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
  },
})
```

2. Configure chunk splitting:

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: {
          vendor: ['react', 'react-dom'],
          // Add other large dependencies
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

## Conclusion

You've successfully migrated from Create React App to Vite! Your application should now have improved development performance and build times. Remember to:

- Update any CI/CD scripts to use the new build commands
- Test thoroughly in development and production environments
- Update documentation to reflect the new Vite-based workflow
