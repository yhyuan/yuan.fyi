Here's how to split transaction creation, signing, and broadcasting across different computers:
You need to start bitcoind.

```bash
bitcoind -conf="C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Bitcoin\bitcoin.conf" -datadir="D:\Bitcoin" -printtoconsole
```

1. On Computer 1 (Create unsigned transaction):
   You need to check the transaction with YOUR_TXID has not been spent. The total of bitcoin in transations is smaller than the amount to be sent. The diference will be paided to miner.

```bash
bitcoin-cli -conf="C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Bitcoin\bitcoin.conf" createrawtransaction '[{"txid":"YOUR_TXID","vout":0}]' '{"RECIPIENT_ADDRESS":0.1}'
```

It will generate a Unsigned Hex string.

2. On Computer 2 (Sign transaction):
   In cold wallet machine, you also need to start `bitcoind`. It is fine that you failed with synchronize with the main net.

```bash
bitcoind -conf="C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Bitcoin\bitcoin.conf" -datadir="D:\Bitcoin" -printtoconsole
```

Create a json string with transactions and append as the last parameter to sign the transation. PRIVATE_KEY is in WIF format.

```bash
bitcoin-cli -conf="C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Bitcoin\bitcoin.conf" signrawtransactionwithkey "UNSIGNED_HEX" '["PRIVATE_KEY"]' '[{"txid":"YOUR_TXID","vout":0,"scriptPubKey":"76a9......","amount":0.1016}]'
```

It will create a hex string and a complete sign to show whether the signing is successful or not.

```json
{
  "hex": "0200000001b........",
  "complete": true
}
```

3. On Computer 1 (Broadcast):

Go back the machine which is connected with mainnet and use the following method to send out the transation.

```bash
bitcoin-cli -conf="C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Bitcoin\bitcoin.conf" sendrawtransaction "SIGNED_HEX"
```

Key points:

- Computer 2 needs private keys
- Copy hex strings between computers securely
- Verify transaction details before broadcasting
- Fees must be included in createrawtransaction
