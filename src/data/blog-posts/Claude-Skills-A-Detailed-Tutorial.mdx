# Claude Skills: A Detailed Tutorial

## What Are Claude Skills?

Claude Skills are specialized knowledge modules that enhance my abilities in specific domains. Think of them as expert "playbooks" - curated sets of best practices, techniques, and workflows that I can access when working on particular types of tasks.

When you ask me to create a document, presentation, spreadsheet, or work with specialized tools, I can read the relevant skill documentation to apply proven techniques and avoid common pitfalls.

## How Skills Work

Skills are stored as markdown files (SKILL.md) in specific directories:
- **Public Skills** (`/mnt/skills/public/`): Core capabilities available to everyone
- **Example Skills** (`/mnt/skills/examples/`): Additional specialized skills
- **User Skills** (`/mnt/skills/user/`): Custom skills you can create yourself

When I encounter a task, I:
1. **Identify** which skill(s) are relevant
2. **Read** the SKILL.md file(s) before starting work
3. **Apply** the best practices and techniques documented in the skill
4. **Execute** the task with enhanced quality and accuracy

Skills contain lessons learned from extensive testing and iteration.

### ✅ **Consistency**
The same high-quality approach is applied every time.

### ✅ **Efficiency**
I don't need to rediscover best practices for each task.

### ✅ **Customization**
You can create skills specific to your workflows and domain expertise.
